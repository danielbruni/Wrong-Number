## Possible New Features
- **Phone Logs**: Keep a record of previous calls, transcripts, and player choices.  
- **Call Waiting**: Occasionally two calls overlap, forcing you to pick which one to answer.  
- **Missed Calls & Voicemails**: Some stories only progress if you let a call go unanswered.  
- **Misdials**: Sometimes you can dial back numbers yourself, discovering hidden content.  
- **Environmental Sounds**: Footsteps, train ambience, creaking floors to hint at context.  
- **Message Glitches**: Text sometimes scrambles or repeats to hint at reality bending.  
- **Evolving Mystery**: A master ‚Äúconspiracy board‚Äù slowly fills out as more calls are completed.  
- **Branch Persistence**: Choices from one story influence later calls (e.g., if you fed Greg‚Äôs stapler delusion, it shows up in Project Reverie).  
- **Cross-Story Clues**: Information gained in one call can unlock hidden dialogue in another.  
- **Multiple Endings**: Each story can conclude in several ways, but also contribute to a larger ‚Äúmeta-ending.‚Äù  
- **Caller Recognition**: Some NPCs call back later, remembering how you treated them.
